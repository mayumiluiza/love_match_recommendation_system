# OkCupid - Matchmaker
Project status(Active)

## Project objective
The goal of this project is to train an unsupervised machine learning model that will be able to recommend dating profiles based on answers from users about who they are and what they like plus what they are looking for in a potential match. 
For the first step of the project, it was made available a visual and user friendly interface on Streamlit to receive inputs from real users to evaluate the profiles the model is recommending.

## Project Description
In a world ditacted by image and looks, imagine you can match people basing on charateristics, interets, beliefs and likes? In other words, imagine you can match people without adding the pyhisical apparence to the math. This idea has been gaining attention after reality shows like "Love is Blind", created and streamed by Netflix, made huge success across the globe. This model aims to begin to understand what people look for in a potential partner. Then, we may have enough information to train a matchmakerrecommendation model.  

## Dataset description
This dataset was created with the use of a python script that pulled the data from public profiles on www.okcupid.com from June 2012. It has an n=59946, which includes people within a 25 mile radius of San Francisco, who were online in the last year, with at least one profile picture.
